    <meta property="og:description" content="Corey Alston is a direct ancestor of a Gullah Geechee family that has been weaving traditional sweetgrass baskets for nearly five generations. The art itself is more than 300 years old and traces its origins back to Africa. Today, his family keeps this special and time-honored craft alive in Charleston, South Carolina, and Alston can often be found selling these treasured baskets at the City Market.">

         Sweetgrass Baskets are historically significant examples of African cultural heritage that were 
         transported across the Atlantic by enslaved African people. Africans from the Windward or Rice Coast of West Africa had
          knowledge and experience with rice cultivation and were, thus, particularly sought after in the Atlantic 
          Slave Trade to Lowcountry. Fearing that they might never return to their homeland, these enslaved people brought their

                        African crafts in America appeared in South Carolina during the late 17th Century. The first 
                        known baskets in the Lowcountry were fanner baskets used for rice production and processing,
                         baskets had a very real and significant
                        cultural connection for the displaced Africans. They were used in the planting and harvesting
                         of the coastal money crops - rice, cotton, and others. Agricultural baskets were made of bulrush, 
                         sweetgrass, and split oak.

                        Sweetgrass baskets began to evolve from agricultural implementations to household items.
                         Sweetgrass, a softer, finer straw, replaced bulrush as the primary material, longleaf 
                         pine needles were added for contrast, and palmetto
                        replaced split oak as binders. On plantations, such as Boone Hall in Mount Pleasant, basket-making continued even after slavery ended.

        Sweetgrass basket sales surged with the opening of the Grace
         Memorial Bridge in 1929 and the paving of Highway17 in 1931. 
         Mount Pleasant area basket makers began a longstanding tradition
          when one lady of vision, Lottie "Winee " Moultrie
        Swinton, soon followed by LydiaSpann Graddick, placed her chair 
        along the highway to display baskets for sale. Thus, roadside basket
         stands were born. Sweetgrass baskets are very durable. Their uses range
          from practical daily use to showpieces. Basketmakers and their baskets 
          are major tourist attractions in the Lowcountry. Today, Sweetgrass baskets are displayed for sale @ Historic 
          Charleston City Market.

                        In July 2009, Mount Pleasant celebrated the opening of the Sweetgrass Cultural Arts Pavilion at the Memorial 
                        Waterfront Park. This open-air pavilion is a tribute to the generations of men and women who have carried on the Lowcountry
                        basket tradition for more than three centuries. The facility provides a venue for local sweetgrass basketmakers 
                        to sell their wares. Kiosks and panels tell the history of the craft. As a stop along the Gullah Geechee Cultural
                        Heritage Corridor, the pavilion gives the public an in-depth look at one of America's oldest and most important
                         African-inspired arts.
