    <meta property="og:description" content="Corey Alston is a direct ancestor of a Gullah Geechee family that has been weaving traditional sweetgrass baskets for nearly five generations. The art itself is more than 300 years old and traces its origins back to Africa. Today, his family keeps this special and time-honored craft alive in Charleston, South Carolina, and Alston can often be found selling these treasured baskets at the City Market.">

                                    Each piece is unique, and each artist develops his or her own style. Basketmakers pledge to continue their traditional craft as long as there are raw materials available, but development or rural areas is threatening

                                <p>African crafts in America, appeared in South Carolina during the late 17th Century. The first known baskets in the lowcountry were fanner baskets used for rice production and proccessing, baskets had a very real and signigicant
                                    cultural connection for the displaced Africans. They were used in the planting and harvesting of the coastal money crops - rice, cotton, and others. Agricultural baskets were made of bulrush, sweetgrass, and split oak.</p>

                                <h3>After the 1890's</h3>
                                <p>Sweetgrass baskets began to evolbe from agricultural implementations to housefold items. Sweetgrass, a softer, finer straw, replaced bul rush as the primary material, long leaf pineneedles were added for contrast, and palmetto
                                    replaced split oak as binders. On plantations, such as Boone Hall in Mount Pleasant, basket making continued even after slavery ended. </p>

                <h4>Sweetgrass basket sales surged with the opening of the Grace Memorial Bridge in 1929 and the paving of Highway17 in 1931. Mount Pleasant area basket makers began a longstanding tradition when one lady of vision, Lottie "Winee " Moultrie
                    Swinton, soon followed by LydiaSpann Graddick, placeed her chair along the highway to display baskets for sale. Thus, roadside basket stands were born. Sweetgrass baskets are very durable. Their uses range from practical daily useto
                    show pieces. Basketmakers and their baskets are major tourist attractions in the lowcountry.</h4>
                <br> Today, Sweetgrass baskets are displayed for sale @ Historic Charleston City Market.
